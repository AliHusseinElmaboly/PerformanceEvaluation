running is illustrated in the report there are screenshoots show how to run the code
1- run simulationFrame
2- there are three button 
first button test the first requirement
second button test the second requirement

changing parameters a , b , m from class LCG

running simulation from button 3 (simulation )
after click button 3 there are two button
